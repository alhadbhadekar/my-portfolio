  longBio:
    "I am a senior software engineer with 8+ years of experience designing and operating resilient, large-scale distributed systems across cloud and enterprise environments. My work sits at the intersection of high-performance backend engineering, platform reliability, and applied AI/ML. I specialize in modernizing legacy platforms into cloud-native microservices, building low-latency APIs, and operating production systems at scale on Kubernetes and AWS.\n\n" +

    "In recent years, my focus has expanded into MLOps and GenAI, where I design and deploy production-grade anomaly detection systems, RAG-based LLM platforms, and intelligent alerting solutions that transform operational data into actionable insights. I enjoy building systems that are not just observable, but self-aware—capable of detecting abnormal behavior, reducing noise, and guiding engineers toward faster root cause analysis.\n\n" +

    "I bring a strong reliability mindset shaped by deep experience in observability, incident response, and automation. I’ve led efforts to instrument platforms with end-to-end metrics, logs, and dashboards, and to close the loop with automated remediation workflows that improve uptime and reduce MTTR. Whether working on backend services, AI-driven automation, or cloud infrastructure, I care deeply about building systems that are robust, explainable, and production-ready.",

  highlights: [
  "Designed and built distributed Go and Python microservices powering high-traffic platforms, consistently achieving sub-100ms latency at 1,000+ RPS in production.",
  
  "Developed and operationalized production AI systems—including anomaly detection, log intelligence, and RAG-based LLM platforms—to reduce alert fatigue and accelerate incident investigation.",
  
  "Led MLOps initiatives by building automated retraining pipelines, model deployment workflows, and multi-agent orchestration frameworks on AWS and Kubernetes.",
  
  "Strengthened platform reliability through deep observability, implementing ELK, Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics, and Grafana dashboards with actionable SLOs and alerts.",
  
  "Built automated remediation and self-healing workflows for recurring production issues, significantly reducing MTTR and improving overall system resilience.",
  
  "Modernized legacy monolithic systems into cloud-native, event-driven architectures using AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and infrastructure-as-code."
